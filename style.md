# Code Style Guidelines

## 1. Naming Conventions
- Use descriptive and meaningful names for variables, functions, and classes.
- Follow camelCase for variables and functions, PascalCase for classes.
- Use UPPER_CASE for constants.
- Prefix private members with an underscore (_).

## 2. Code Structure
- Keep functions short and focused on a single task.
- Limit line length to 80-100 characters for improved readability.
- Use consistent indentation (preferably 2 or 4 spaces).
- Group related code together and separate different functionalities with blank lines.
- Follow the principle of separation of concerns.

## 3. Documentation
- Write clear and concise comments for complex logic or non-obvious code.
- Use docstrings for functions, classes, and modules, describing purpose, parameters, and return values.
- Keep comments up-to-date with code changes.
- Include a README file with project overview, setup instructions, and usage examples.

## 4. Error Handling
- Use try-except blocks to handle exceptions gracefully.
- Provide informative error messages for caught exceptions.
- Avoid catching generic exceptions; be specific about what errors to catch.
- Log errors and exceptions for debugging purposes.

## 5. Performance
- Optimize code for readability first, then for performance if necessary.
- Use appropriate data structures and algorithms for efficient operations.
- Avoid unnecessary computations or function calls in loops.
- Profile code to identify and address performance bottlenecks.

## 6. Security
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs to prevent injection attacks.
- Use parameterized queries for database operations to prevent SQL injection.
- Implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- Follow the principle of least privilege when designing system access.
- Keep sensitive information (e.g., API keys, passwords) out of source code.

## 7. Version Control
- Use meaningful commit messages that describe the changes made.
- Make small, focused commits rather than large, multi-purpose ones.
- Use feature branches for developing new features or major changes.
- Regularly merge or rebase with the main branch to stay up-to-date.

## 8. Testing
- Write unit tests for individual components and functions.
- Aim for high test coverage, especially for critical parts of the codebase.
- Include integration tests for testing component interactions.
- Run tests automatically as part of the CI/CD pipeline.

## 9. Code Review
- Conduct regular code reviews to ensure code quality and knowledge sharing.
- Use a checklist for code reviews to ensure consistency.
- Provide constructive feedback and be open to receiving it.
- Address all review comments before merging code.

## 10. Maintenance
- Regularly refactor code to improve its structure and readability.
- Keep dependencies up-to-date and regularly check for security vulnerabilities.
- Remove dead code and unused variables/imports.
- Document technical debt and plan for its resolution.
